Option 1: Student Progress

I would target each grouping of students at different levels with a unique strategy to execute and they are as follows:

To get the 5 lagging students back on track:

    - Schedule a meeting with each student to understand why they are behind on their expected progress.
    - Work with each student to develop an individualized plan to help them catch up, which may include extra study materials or more frequent check-ins with their mentor.
    - Set specific goals with each student and track their progress towards meeting those goals.
    - Encourage and motivate students to stay on track and communicate with them regularly to offer support and guidance.

To ensure that the 10 at-risk students do not fall behind, I would take the following actions:

    -Send a reminder message to these students to complete their next task within the next 2 days.
    -Provide extra resources or support to help them complete their next task.
    -Offer additional assistance and mentoring to help them get back on track if they fall behind.

To ensure that the 5 students that are ahead are not negatively impacted, I would take the following actions:

    -Offer them the opportunity to take on additional challenges or tasks to further enhance their learning.
    -Encourage them to mentor and support their peers who may be struggling.
    -Continue to challenge and engage them with additional resources or projects to keep them motivated.

Overall, I feel the critical cornerstone is to communicate regularly with all students and to provide them with the necessary resources and support to ensure that they are successful in their bootcamp and overall academic career.

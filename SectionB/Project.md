One of the projects I am most proud of creating is my portfolio website which is currently cloud-hosted on Firebase:

The link to the repo of the code: 
https://github.com/CaretakerJH/JHerrPortfolioWebpage

The link to the web-application: 
https://jherr-port.web.app/

It was built using:
    Front-end library: React
    CSS framework: React-bootstrap
    CSS animations library: Animate.css

A large amount of time was put into getting the styling correct to give the web-application and smooth and beautiful over-all feel.
